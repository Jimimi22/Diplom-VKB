<h3>YA!BUCKS is pay-per-install affiliate program.</h3>
<p class="p1">Unlike others we
not paying fixed rate for install and not shave installs. We
share our profit with you. Yes, that's true - we really giving
you a share - 70% from revenue. Our software can live a lot of
months on user PC's and you earn money every day and every hour,
doesn't matter - if you already stop sending installs - you
still earning money with us. In typical pay-per-install
partnership programs everyone get same CPD, in this case some
affiliates(with "bad quality" installs) become banned after few
days(weeks, months) and without payout, and some affiliates(with
"good quality" installs) not receiving as much money as those
installs really costs. And PPI company closes business after
some time(we know a lot of samples). Only revenue share model is
really fair and can bring really big revenue to affiliates.
That's all what we can say. Now - you can join us and try it or
leave our site - it's up to you, but we suggesting - give us a
try and you will be amazed with results!</p>
